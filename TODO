* Fix bug in daily report.  If time crosses midnight, the piece on the next
  day isn't tabulated (since there isn't a started at message on that day)

* Report on most time consuming tasks

* Add report for context switches, how many occurred, how many by hour, which
  tasks were most interrupted?

* Multi-project tt. If current directory has a .tt dir, then tt will use that,
  otherwise it will look for .tt in your home directory. This means you can
  separate tasks per project.

* Improve bash completion, use bash_completion.d where available, otherwise
  fall back to manual addition

* Add hooks for each status change

* With hooks, add git integration
    Push on close?
    Commit on status change?
    git-init on tt init?

* Add command to rebuild `tasks/state/status` directory.
  This should be run automatically after editing a file.
  This should also find orphaned tasks. Tasks not linked from status dir
  should be 'closed'. tt fsck?

* Move _tt_completer into tt itself

* Add man page

* Flag tasks > 8 hours and cross midnight as "suspicious", allow user to
* "verify"

* Add colorization

* Run Pep-8 on code, add pep8 git hook

* Delete closed tasks older than a given date (archive if using git)

* Create fixtures
